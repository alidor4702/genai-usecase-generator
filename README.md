## What this is

Take-home for the **Mistral Proto Team Applied AI Engineer** role. Goal: take a company name, return three relevant, iconic, high-impact GenAI use cases. The system runs on Mistral Workflows, publishes to Le Chat as an assistant, and ships a polished standalone web app with live agent activity, structured cards, run history, and a grounding-data explorer.

The Mistral team's evaluation criteria — methodology, architecture, code quality, documentation, output quality — are listed in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). Every commit was made with those in mind.

## Try it

**1. Standalone web app (Vercel + Render):**
- Live URL: [`https://compastral.vercel.app`](https://compastral.vercel.app)
- Type a company name (try `Carrefour` for the cleanest sample, `Mistral AI` to see the cat-ear logo Easter egg). Watch the live agent feed, get a structured report with grounding chips.

**2. Le Chat assistant:**
- `chat.mistral.ai` → Assistants → search **"GenAI Use Case Generator"** → Install → chat. Type a company name; the assistant runs the full pipeline (~3-5 min) with a live `TodoList` checklist showing each phase. Final report renders inline as chunked markdown + mermaid blueprints.
- See [`docs/publish_le_chat.md`](docs/publish_le_chat.md) for publish steps.

**3. Locally (CLI):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alidor4702/genai-usecase-generator.git
cd genai-usecase-generator
uv sync
cp .env.example .env       # paste MISTRAL_API_KEY + TAVILY_API_KEY
uv run python -m scripts.run_example "Carrefour" --out docs/examples/local/carrefour.md
```

## What good output looks like

For Carrefour (v9.1, latest batch in [`docs/examples/v9_1/`](docs/examples/v9_1)):

- **Fact-check pass rate:** 92% (24/26 substantive claims supported by retrieved sources)
- **Meta-evaluator confidence:** 0.77 — sales-engineer-ready
- **Per-claim transparency block** with chips: `[verified ↗ Reuters]` / `[corrected ↗ → 56 countries]` / `[judge: rejected]` / `[rewritten qualitatively]`
- Three customer-ready use cases:
  1. *AI-powered own-brand nutritional insight engine for the 14k-store network*
  2. *Dynamic promotion optimizer for perishable inventory across European hypermarkets*
  3. *Supplier-ESG risk-scoring agent on Carrefour's 50k-supplier base*
- Each with: refined description, why-this-company, example user query + system output, blueprint mermaid (color-coded by pattern), TTV estimate (precedent-anchored or honestly tagged "ballpark"), top implementation risk, Mistral product picks, citations linked to a per-run grounding database.

```

The system has **four user surfaces**:

| Surface | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Standalone web app** | Vercel + Render (FastAPI + Next.js) | Live agent activity feed (SSE), structured use case cards, theme toggle, run history, grounding explorer |
| **Le Chat assistant** | `chat.mistral.ai` (after publish) | Chat-native UX with `ConfirmationInput` + live `TodoList` progress + chunked-markdown final output |
| **CLI** | `scripts/run_example.py` | Static markdown report + execution trace + grounding addendum, written to disk |
| **API** | FastAPI on Render | `/generate`, `/status`, `/events` (SSE), `/report`, `/grounding`, `/runs`, `/runs/{id}` |

## Methodology

Five scoring criteria with configurable weights:

| Criterion | What it asks |
|---|---|
| **Relevance** | Touches a core business workflow at scale, with the data and stated priorities to make it work |
| **Iconic potential** | Visibly distinctive for THIS company AND not already done by them (hard gate) |
| **Estimated impact** | Measurable financial or strategic value, anchored to peer deployments |
| **Feasibility** | Shippable with current GenAI tech in a customer engagement timeline |
| **Mistral suitability** | Leans into Mistral's distinctive strengths (sovereignty, open-weight, multilingual, cost) |

**Three principles drive the design:**

1. **Proven-elsewhere vs already-done-here** — the system distinguishes "peer companies have proven this is feasible" (positive signal) from "this company has already deployed it" (hard disqualifier). Filtered across four layers: existing-initiatives during research, hard score cap on iconic-potential, per-candidate Tavily verification, meta-eval cross-cutting concern.
2. **Grounding, not derivation** — precedents are evidence of feasibility, not templates. The generator must produce ≥3/12 candidates as `novel_direction` (combinations, original framings).
3. **Refusal as a feature** — when research signal is too sparse to confidently generate, the system refuses gracefully and asks for more context, never fabricates.

Full methodology rationale in [`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md).

## The fact-check chain (the v6→v9.2 evolution)

The most distinctive thing about this build is what happens AFTER the LLM produces the prose. Every iteration sharpened it.

| Version | What changed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **v5** | Baseline: meta-eval reads evidence pool, marks claims supported/unsupported | ~80% pass rate but fact-checker was too narrow — flagged real claims as fabricated |
| **v6** | **Web-verify rescue layer** — for unsupported claims, run one targeted Tavily search; 2-tier credibility (allowlist domain → "verified", entity/number anchor → "corroborated"). + 5 prompt fixes (atomic claim splitting, polish gets full ledger, `free_text_notes` priority, peer-attribution rule, TTV ballpark tag). | Caught real claims meta-eval missed. Pass rates jumped to ~95%. Confidence math broken (capped at 0.65). |
| **v7** | **Source-judge layer** — Mistral Small reads each (claim, source URL) pair and decides if the source actually supports the claim vs. just mentions related entities. **Final-qualify** — surgical rewrite of still-unsupported numerics. **Numbers symmetry** — polish stops pre-stripping; verify chain decides. | Caught false positives (wrong-source citations) the v6 rescue was rubber-stamping. |
| **v8** | Pass-rate denominator excludes qualified-out claims. Confidence calibration clamps `qual_delta ∈ [-0.15, +0.10]`. Veolia near-dup rendering bug. Peer-attribution rule strengthened to anonymous peers. | Made the headline metric reflect what the prose actually asserts; fixed Mistral 91% pass / 0.55 confidence inversion. |
| **v9** | **Self-correcting judge** — third verdict `corrected`. When source contradicts a numeric/rank/temporal claim with a clean replacement, the judge returns the corrected value as a drop-in phrase; the system patches the prose inline + attaches the source link + marks the claim with a `[corrected ↗ → <value>]` chip. Restricted to numerics (entity contradictions stay unsupported — silent entity-substitution would break downstream prose). + drop regen_one (~50s saved), parallelize verify deep-read, source_judge concurrency 4→8. | Closes the loop: real fabrications get rewritten with the actual value, not just qualified out. |
| **v9.1** | Phantom-claim post-process strip (LLM was copying prompt template literals as claims). Feature-description filter strengthened with "Acme Corp swap test". Source-judge extends to all supported claims (was URL-only). | Removed extraction noise. Catches the L'Oreal Galderma slip-through (supporting quote didn't actually mention the brands). |
| **v9.2** | Two surgical prompt edits — judge accepts inference-from-context (Paris HQ → EU regulatory alignment); generation prompt blocks superlatives ("ONLY EU-sovereign") via the existing peer-attribution rule. | Recovers reasonable inferences without adding new logic; closes a generation-prompt gap. |

End-to-end behavior:

```
Substantive claim from prose
    │
    └── Anchored in evidence pool? ── yes ──→ supported (with source_kind=evidence:ev-id)
                                  └── no  ──→ Web-verify Tavily search
                                                 │
                                                 └── Domain allowlisted? ──→ supported (rescue_tier=verified)
                                                 └── Entity/number anchor? → supported (rescue_tier=corroborated)
                                                 └── Nothing? ────────────→ unsupported
    │
    Source-judge (v7+v9): for every supported claim with a resolvable URL OR
    supporting_signal text, ask Mistral Small "does this source actually support?":
        ├── supported     → render with citation
        ├── corrected     → patch prose with source's actual value, add [corrected ↗] chip
        └── unsupported   → flip back, judge_rejected chip
    │
    Final qualify: any still-unsupported numeric/named claim → surgical qualitative rewrite
    │
    Pass-rate metric: excludes qualified_out (the prose no longer asserts them)
    Confidence: re-anchor on new pass-rate, qual_delta clamped [-0.15, +0.10]
    │
    Persist Report to SQLite runs table → /history page can replay later
```

| Source-judge | `mistral-small-2603` | 0.1 |
| Final qualify | `mistral-small-2603` | 0.1 |
| Embeddings | `mistral-embed` | — |

### Research and data
- Wikipedia / Wikidata REST APIs (no auth)
- Tavily Search API (news + per-candidate verification + web_search tool + rescue layer)
- SQLite for the data layer (companies index, precedent corpus, cache, **runs history**)
- numpy in-memory matrix for embedding similarity at prototype scale
- Production migration path: Postgres + pgvector + Redis (mentioned only)

### Frontend (standalone web app)
- **Next.js 14** App Router · **TypeScript strict mode**
- **Tailwind CSS** with Mistral palette + light/dark mode (cookie-persisted, smooth fade transition)
- **`react-markdown`** + **`remark-gfm`**
- **`mermaid.js`** with custom per-node-type + per-blueprint-pattern color decoration
- **EventSource** for SSE live agent feed

### Deployment
- **Render** for FastAPI backend (`render.yaml` blueprint) + worker for Le Chat assistant
- **Vercel** for Next.js frontend (`standalone/vercel.json`)
- Auto-deploy on every push to `main`

## Engineering rigor

- **Workflow class is deterministic** — no `datetime.now()`, no `random()`, no I/O in `src/workflow.py`. Mistral Workflows replays workflow history; non-determinism breaks replay.
- **Every side effect lives in an activity** — every LLM call, web fetch, DB read, embedding has explicit `start_to_close_timeout`.
- **Typed boundaries** — every activity has Pydantic input + Pydantic output. Every LLM call uses `response_format` with a JSON schema. No prose-parsing downstream.
- **`pyright --strict` clean** on the source tree.
- **44 tests** (`pytest tests/`) covering the typed models, criteria scoring, quality signals, evidence ledger, phantom-claim filter, and rendering.
- **Prompt versioning** — all 16 system prompts live in `src/prompts.py` and `src/activities/*.py` constants; `docs/prompts.md` is the regenerated single source of truth.

## Persistence + history

Every completed run is persisted to a `runs` table in SQLite. The FE has a [`/history`](https://compastral.vercel.app/history) page listing all past runs, brief-rendered with company name, status chip (completed / refused / failed), confidence, fact-check pass rate, duration, "X ago" timestamp. Click any one to re-open the full structured report (cards, blueprints, fact-check transparency) without re-running the pipeline.

```
SQLite schema (runs table):
  run_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY
  company_name TEXT
  status TEXT                    -- completed / refused / failed
  started_at INTEGER             -- unix epoch
  completed_at INTEGER
  fact_check_pass_rate REAL
  meta_eval_confidence REAL
  sales_engineer_ready INTEGER
  report_json TEXT               -- full Report.model_dump_json()
  report_markdown TEXT
  refusal_reason TEXT
  error TEXT
```

Auto-saves in the FastAPI background-task `finally:` block (best-effort — a persistence failure doesn't mask the actual run outcome).

> **Render free-tier caveat:** the live deployment uses a free Render web service. The free tier wipes its filesystem on every cold start (the service spins down after ~15 min idle), so the SQLite `runs` table resets to empty between sessions. **Runs older than the most recent warm-up window will not appear on `/history`.** Production migration paths: Render Starter ($7/mo, service stays warm), Render's Persistent Disk add-on (~$1/mo for 1GB), or Postgres on Render's free tier (per `docs/architecture.md` "Production migration path"). For local CLI use the SQLite at `data/genai_usecases.db` is durable.

## Grounding explorer

For every run, [`/grounding/{run_id}`](https://compastral.vercel.app/grounding/) shows every source the pipeline read — Wikipedia, news, Tavily, per-candidate verification, web-verify rescue, claim-verification — with full metadata + content excerpt. Filter by source kind, by use case, full-text search. Plus a **Used / Not-used** summary at the top showing which retrieval paths fired vs which were available but didn't trigger this run (e.g. depth=low → no jobs / no news).

CLI runs also write a `<company>_grounding.md` companion file alongside the report, with the same data as a static appendix.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- `uv` (`brew install uv` or `pipx install uv`)
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`

### CLI
```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env       # paste keys
uv run python -m scripts.run_example "Carrefour" \
    --focus general --depth medium \
    --out docs/examples/local/carrefour.md
```

### Standalone web app (FastAPI + Next.js)
```bash
# Backend
uv run uvicorn src.api:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd standalone
npm install
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run dev
# → open http://localhost:3000
```

### Le Chat worker (publish to Le Chat)
```bash
uv run python -m scripts.run_worker
# leave running; assistant becomes invokable in Le Chat
```

See [`docs/publish_le_chat.md`](docs/publish_le_chat.md) for the publish flow.

### Tests + lint
```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q
uv run ruff check src/ --select F
uv run pyright src/
```

## Data sources

Two narrow places + a lot of live web. Full breakdown in [`docs/data_sources.md`](docs/data_sources.md).

| Type | Source | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **PRESET (closed corpus)** | Precedent corpus | `data/genai_usecases.db` (~2,150 entries — Google Cloud customer stories + Evidently AI blueprints + Google Cloud blueprints) |
| **PRESET** | Verified-companies index | `data/companies_raw.jsonl` (hand-curated; rapidfuzz match → confidence boost) |
| **PRESET** | Web-verify allowlist | `src/web_verify.py:_ALLOWLIST_DOMAINS` (Reuters, FT, Bloomberg, Le Monde, gov.fr, europa.eu, …) |
| **LIVE WEB** | Wikipedia / Wikidata | `en.wikipedia.org` REST API + Wikidata SPARQL |
| **LIVE WEB** | Tavily | News search, per-candidate verification, web_search tool, web-verify rescue |
| **LIVE WEB** | Direct HTTP | News article deep-reads, career pages (with Playwright fallback) |

The fact-check rescue chain (web-verify + source-judge) is **fully live web**, gated by the curated allowlist for tier-1 trust.

## Cost characteristics

Per run, at `tier=standard`:
- **~14 LLM calls** (research synthesis, industry-label polish, gap-fill × 4, generation, scoring × 2, per-candidate verification × 3, enrichment, polish, meta-eval, judge × ~25 pairs, final-qualify × 3) — ~$0.10-0.20 in Mistral API credits
- **~10-15 Tavily searches** (news, gap-fill, per-candidate verify, web-verify rescue) — ~$0.05-0.10
- **~5-10 HTTP fetches** (Wikipedia, news deep-reads) — free
- **~250s wall-clock** end-to-end (down from 5+ min in v8 after the v9 perf passes)

Total ~$0.20-0.30 per run.

## Quality and evaluation

Five-company canonical benchmark (Carrefour, Veolia, BNP Paribas, L'Oréal, Mistral AI), tracked across versions in [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples). Each version's outputs are committed alongside their execution traces (`*_trace.md`) and grounding addenda (`*_grounding.md`).

Latest run (v9.1, Carrefour):
- 92% fact-check pass rate
- 0.77 meta-evaluator confidence — sales-engineer-ready
- 2 legitimate judge rejections (real catches: ungrounded "store management systems" claim + ungrounded "organic supply chains" claim)
- 0 phantom claims (v9.1 anonymisation eliminated the prompt-leak class)

Quality signals computed per run: LLM-graded diversity, LLM-graded specificity per use case, Mistral product diversity, fact-check pass rate, TTV/cost-tier spread, source coverage. All visible in the report's quality footer.

## Known limitations

- **AI-vendor-as-target produces tautological proposals.** When the target IS Mistral / OpenAI / Anthropic, the framing breaks down. Documented; would need a prompt branch to address.
- **Precedent corpus is closed (~2,150 deployments).** Every `inspired_by` reference must live in `data/genai_usecases.db`. Free-text peer references are allowed (with the v6 quantitative-attribution rule).
- **Tier-2 corroborated rescues use regex anchor matching.** v9 source-judge is the corrective layer; if the LLM judge call fails (transient API error), the system fails open and keeps the corroboration.
- **v9.2 inference-from-context is a heuristic.** The judge accepts "Paris HQ" → "EU regulatory alignment" via geographic logic. Most of the time this is right; occasionally over-permissive.

## What I'd add with more time

- **Score self-consistency ablation.** Step 4 runs two passes (T=0.2 + T=0.4) for ~18s/run cost; never measured against a single pass at T=0.3 to confirm the marginal value.
- **Parallelize enrichment per use case.** Save ~30s but risks regression in Mistral product diversity / cross-cutting concern handling — needs a 5-company A/B before deciding.
- **Real-time event-driven cache invalidation.** Hook into news APIs to force-refresh when a company has a major announcement.
- **Earnings call and 10-K ingestion.** For public companies, parse recent transcripts and SEC filings.
- **Multi-language reports.** Generate in the company's primary geography's language (French for Veolia, etc.).
- **Production migration.** Postgres + pgvector for embeddings, Redis for cache. Same code paths, different connection strings.
- **Active corpus expansion.** When a generated use case is judged high-quality, write it back to the precedent corpus.

## Prior work

The methodology builds on a few canonical references:
- The "proven-elsewhere vs already-done-here" distinction is core to applied-AI use-case discovery.
- The five-criteria rubric is the union of standard "GenAI use case prioritization" frameworks (Gartner / McKinsey / Forrester).
- Self-consistency in scoring is from [Wang et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171).
- The corrected-verdict pattern (replace contradicted values with source values inline) is novel here, IIRC — it was designed in the v8→v9 conversation as a response to the v8 over-rejection problem.

## Submission notes

This take-home was built over [~7 days of iterative work](https://github.com/alidor4702/genai-usecase-generator/commits/main). The full timeline is visible in the git log; major milestones tagged in commit messages (v6 / v6 audit / v7 / v7.1 / v8 / v9 / v9.1 / v9.2). All 9 versions of the 5-company canonical batch are committed under `docs/examples/v*/` so reviewers can read the actual generated reports + execution traces + grounding addenda without running anything.
